## About Me

Hi there! I'm Hossam Elwahsh, an electrical engineering graduate with a strong passion for embedded software engineering. I'm currently seeking opportunities to kickstart my career as a junior embedded software engineer, particularly in the exciting field of automotive software.

**`Background:`** I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Electronics and Communication in 2021, graduating with a cumulative grade of 72.84% from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

**`Experience:`** I recently completed a rigorous Automotive Software Bootcamp, where I honed my skills in C programming, UML, microcontroller programming (AVR and ARM architectures), and adhering to software reliability guidelines like MISRA and ISO 26262. I'm well-versed in build tools like CMake and Makefile and have a comprehensive understanding of Real-Time Operating Systems, particularly FreeRTOS. Additionally, I completed an ISTQB CTFL crash course, enhancing my testing competencies.

**`Skills:`** My programming expertise includes embedded C, C#, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, and SQL. I'm proficient in scripting languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have experience with various software programs such as Eclipse, Visual Studio, Atmel Studio, Keil uVision, CLion, SimSo, and Code Composer. I'm also well-versed in Linux administration and have skills in pen-testing and problem-solving.

I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges. If you're interested in collaborating on exciting embedded software projects or have an opportunity you think would be a good fit for my skills, please don't hesitate to reach out!

  - `Role` Circuit Schematic (Proteus), Drivers _(DIO, SPI, Multifunctional BTN, LCD)_, ATM ECU Application Layer Software, Video Editing
  - `Extra` Introduced a communication plan between the two ECUs using SPI due to the lack of verification in the SPI frame.

- #### Design non-blocking LCD and Keypad (Design Only)
  [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/HossamElwahsh/sprints-automotive/tree/main/Embedded%20SW%20Design/S_STATIC_01%20-%20Design%20a%20Non-blocking%20LCD%20and%20Keypad)
  - `Role` _Individual Task_

- ### Design and implement BCM (Basic Communication Manager)
    [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/HossamElwahsh/sprints-automotive/tree/87d788ba79fdbbaf72a1c2603bbf893d77767e96/Embedded%20SW%20Design/S_DYNAMIC_08%20Implement%20a%20BCM/shared) [![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-%23FF0000.svg?style=flat&logo=YouTube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/QXWsYwRUksM)

- ### Design and implement SOS (Small OS)
    [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/HossamElwahsh/sprints_avr_small_operating_system_project) 
  - This project aims to deliver an SOS -Small Operating System - which will manage the scheduling of some tasks. The project will resemble RTOS and for the delivery, it will be tested on some output/input modules which will toggle LEDs at different periodicity and check the buttonsâ€™ states too.
  
- ### EDF Scheduler (Earliest Deadline first - FreeRTOS)
    [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/HossamElwahsh/sprints_avr_small_operating_system_project) 
  - Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a scheduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task. 
    In this project, we are designing an EDF scheduler based on FreeRTOS `10.3.0`
